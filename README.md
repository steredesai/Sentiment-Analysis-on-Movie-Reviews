# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The project aims to classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments using a range of machine learning and deep learning models. The study includes preprocessing techniques and model evaluations to understand the efficacy of different approaches in sentiment classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IMDB Movie Review dataset, consisting of 50,000 movie reviews labeled with positive or negative sentiments.

## Code Files
- `sentiment_analysis.py`: Python script for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `data_exploration.py`: Python script for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
